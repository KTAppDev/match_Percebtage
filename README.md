# match_Percebtage
This is part of a larger project, decided to share.
This code takes two sentences and compares them to see how closely matched they are.
This is my own code and it works perfectly for my uses.

I originally wrote this to compare title headlines from local news websites i webscrape.
On any given day, all the websites can have the same story with the title being very similar, this helps me check for duplicate article.
30% match works for me.
There is comments explaining most things in the code.
